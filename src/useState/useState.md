# Use State Hook:

- useState() is a function which take a parameter like string, array, number, etc. 
- useState() return two values:
1. It return the value which is passed to it.
2. A function which set(change) the default passed value. 

- No need to import the useState, because if use React.useState() it also work, but for good practice import the files.
- <React.Fragment> or <> </> is used to wrap all the element like the div do.
- spread operator(...) satrt with 3 dots and the name, use of that is it keep the old value or copy the old value as it is and if we want to change any specific value we change it.
